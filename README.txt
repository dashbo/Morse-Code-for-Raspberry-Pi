# Morse-Code-for-Raspberry-Pi
Uses Raspberry Pi GPIO to broadcast Morse code.

This is a simple program to broadcast a string
via the GPIO pins using a Raspberry Pi. It uses
the RPi.GPIO Python module to control the output.

Hook up your LED (and resistor) to pin 17 and a
buzzer to pin 22. Launch the program, type your
message and hit enter. You will see your message
translated on screen and broadcast with the LED
and buzzer. Enjoy!

P.S. If you want to know more about Morse Code,
go to itu.int as they are the current "gatekeepers"
of modern Morse Code. I wrote this program based
on their specifications.
